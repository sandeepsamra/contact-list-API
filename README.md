Contact List API
=============

This is a single-page app that allows a user to save and delete contacts, as well as view a list of the contacts they have already saved. If the user adds or deletes a contact while they have their contact list on the page, the list will be dynamically updated. It was build using Javascript, jQuery, Sinatra, HTML and CSS (Bootstrap).
